Description: A series of analyses of the results of the survey software, including micro homology analysis, etc.
    A significant proportion of human cancers result from the integration of viruses
    into the human genome. Therefore, investigating the mechanisms of viral 
    integration is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of many 
    devastating diseases. Microhomology (MH) analysis at viral integration sites 
    plays a critical role in the study of viral integration mechanisms. 
    Previous research has shown a significant enrichment of microhomology (MH) 
    between the human genome and the human papillomavirus (HPV) genome at 
    integration breakpoints or nearby regions. To facilitate MH analysis, we have 
    developed the mhAnalysis software package.
